Brainbrush is a quiz style puzzle game where you must try to work out colorful expressions which involve adding, removing, and inversing colors in order to understand what color each of the 18 puzzles is referring to. However, getting questions right and wrong is handled in a much more unique way, as instead of getting a traditional check mark or red X, you'll instead build up large quantities of red and green splotches of paint, which will permanently color your quiz screen until you manage to win, permanently showing off your achievements as well as your failings!
